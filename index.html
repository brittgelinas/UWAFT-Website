<!-- Website requirements (taken from the facebook page, see:https://www.facebook.com/groups/591982934192138/permalink/592857804104651/)

Problems with the old website:
    - looks horrible
    - boring
    - generic

The solution needs to:
    - be unique
    - think auto manufacturer
        > http://www.teslamotors.com
        > http://www.ds5.citroen.com

Requirements:
    - land on uwaft.com and see cars
    - market the current vehicle (Malibu)
    - showcase the older cars as well
    - for each vehicle we need to show:
        > pictures
        > features
        > specs
        > architecture
    - have a page to show the lab, facility and other pictures
    - have a page to show the team, the categories are:
        > engineering
            - core
            - co-op
            - 4th year
        > business
        > communications
    - a test drive button
    - a place to play mini-games
